Project Conclusion\n","\n","In this project, the objective was to analyze the provided dataset and build a model to predict product ratings. The following steps were performed:\n","\n","1.  **Data Loading and Initial Exploration:** The dataset was loaded into a pandas DataFrame, and an initial inspection was done to understand the data structure and identify missing values.\n","\n","2.  **Data Preprocessing:**\n","    *   A new feature `discounted_price` was created by subtracting the sale price from the market price.\n","    *   Missing values in the `rating`, `product`, `brand`, and `description` columns were handled. For the `rating` column, missing values were imputed with the mean rating of their respective categories. Missing values in `product`, `brand`, and `description` were filled with 'not_available' or 0.\n","    *   Categorical features were encoded into numerical representations using `OrdinalEncoder`.\n","    *   A new categorical target variable `Rating_meth` was created based on the numerical `rating` column, categorizing ratings into 'good', 'average', 'below_average', and 'not rated'.\n","\n","3.  **Model Training and Evaluation (Regression):**\n","    *   Initial attempts were made to predict the numerical `rating` using `LinearRegression` and `RandomForestRegressor`.\n","    *   The R2 score for `LinearRegression` was approximately 0.01, indicating a very poor fit.\n","    *   The R2 score for `RandomForestRegressor` was approximately 0.09, which was better than linear regression but still suggested that regression was not the most effective approach for predicting the continuous rating directly.\n","\n","4.  **Model Training and Evaluation (Classification):**\n","    *   Given the poor performance of regression, the problem was reframed as a classification task to predict the `Rating_meth` categories.\n","    *   `RandomForestClassifier` and `XGBClassifier` models were trained.\n","    *   The initial `RandomForestClassifier` achieved an accuracy of approximately 0.70 on the test set.\n","    *   The initial `XGBClassifier` achieved an accuracy of approximately 0.70 on the test set.\n","\n","5.  **Addressing Class Imbalance:**\n","    *   Techniques like SMOTE and SMOTEENN were used to address potential class imbalance in the training data.\n","    *   Applying SMOTE before training the `RandomForestClassifier` resulted in a test accuracy of approximately 0.68.\n","    *   Applying SMOTEENN before training the `RandomForestClassifier` resulted in a significantly lower test accuracy of approximately 0.56, suggesting that this technique might not be suitable for this dataset or model.\n","\n","6.  **Feature Selection:**\n","    *   Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with `RandomForestClassifier` was used to select the most important features. The selected features were 'product', 'sale\\_price', and 'type'.\n","    *   Training the `RandomForestClassifier` on these selected features resulted in a test accuracy of approximately 0.65. This indicates that using only the features selected by RFE did not improve the model's performance in this case.\n","\n","7.  **Hyperparameter Tuning:**\n","    *   A small grid search was performed using `GridSearchCV` to find the best parameters for the `RandomForestClassifier` with the selected features. The parameters tuned were `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, and `min_samples_split`.\n","    *   The best parameters found were `max_depth=10`, `min_samples_split=2`, and `n_estimators=200`.\n","    *   The test accuracy with the best parameters from the grid search was approximately 0.62.\n","\n","**Conclusion and Best Option:**\n","\n","Based on the experiments conducted, the classification approach to predict rating categories ('good', 'average', 'below_average', 'not rated') yielded better results compared to the regression approach. Both the `RandomForestClassifier` and `XGBClassifier` achieved similar initial accuracy scores of around 0.70.\n","\n","While hyperparameter tuning with a small grid search and feature selection with RFE were explored, they did not lead to a significant improvement in accuracy in this instance. The initial `RandomForestClassifier` or `XGBClassifier` trained on all the features (after handling missing values and encoding) appear to be the best options among the models and techniques explored so far, both achieving an accuracy of approximately 0.70.\n","\n"],"id":"00fc0fd0"},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"nP_ONVZKXLIb"},"id":"nP_ONVZKXLIb","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.13.5"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
